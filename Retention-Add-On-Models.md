The conditional bonuses was based on the employee's position and length of employment at the end of FY 24. The conditions are as follows:
- Teachers
  - $1,000 for 2 years
  - $1,500 for 3 years
  - Bonuses increase by $500 with each year of service until a maximum of 10 years at which a bonus of $5,000 will be received
  - $5,000 for 10+

  - $5,000 10+ years

## Uniform Bonus

The uniform bonus model was based soley on the employee's length of employment, not position.The bonus scale is as follows:

- $1,000 for 2 years
- $1,500 for 3 years
- Bonuses increases by $500 with each year of service until a maximum of 10 years at a bonus of $5,000 will be received
- $5,000 for 10+ years

# Conclusion 

The **Uniform Bonus Model** is more equitabale than the **Conditioinal Bonus Model** at minimal cost. In total, the **Uniform Bonus Model** would cost $215,500 while the **Conditioinal Bonus Model** would cost $212,500, a difference of $3,000. However, the **Uniform Bonus Model** allows associates to earn a larger bonus in respect to their superiors.
