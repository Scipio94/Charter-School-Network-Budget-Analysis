# Charter School Budget Analysis


## Abstract

A small charter school network is performing a quantitative budget analysis to calculate the number of filled and vacant positions for all part-time, full-time, and contracted employees as well as deficits and surpluses in department and school budgets to work collaboratively with the Talent department ahead of the upcoming recruiting season to make effective hires.

## Objective

The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

1. What is the typical length of employment and how does it vary across different departments, campuses, or roles?
2. What is the difference in the projected and actual salaries for both departments and campuses?
3. How many positions were unbudgeted and what is the amount of unbudgeted salaries?


## Analysis 
1. What is the typical length of employment and how does it vary across different departments, campuses, or roles?

In total, the small charter school network has 186 part-time, full-time, and contracted positions, majority, approximately 86%, of which are filled. The minimum length of employment is approximately a week  while the maximum length of employment is slightly above 14 years. The average length of employment at  is approximately 3 years and 5 months. However, due to an uneven distribution, right skew, in the histogram above the median length of employment, approximately 2 years, is a better indication of the typical length of employment of employees in the small charterschool network.
